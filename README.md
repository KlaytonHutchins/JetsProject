# JetsProject

## Details
This project simulates the fleet of aircraft at an airfield. The program first reads the contents of a text file and 
instantiates an airplane for each line in the file. Then the program displays a menu to the user. Based on user 
selection, the program will display all information of all planes at the airfield, implement a method of planes 
based on their characteristics, display the "best" airplane in a given category, or add/remove an airplane from 
the fleet. The user continues to choose from the menu options until he/she chooses to quit the program and exit 
the airfield.
